# Elephant_Cat_Mouse
A simple but fun game built in Python with Tkinter – inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, but with a twist!
Instead of rock, paper, and scissors, you play with elephant, cat, and mouse.

This project was created as part of my Python programming for AI development.

Gameplay
The game follows simple rules:

🐘 The elephant stomps the cat
🐱 The cat chases the mouse
🐭 The mouse scares the elephant

Pick one of the animals — the computer will randomly choose its own — and see who comes out on top!
First to 10 points wins the game!
